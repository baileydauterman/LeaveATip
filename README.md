Tired of people using your code without recognizing you? Use PowerShell Leave-A-Tip repo to get what you deserve from people using your code!!

```PowerShell
Write-TipAsk
```

Want to change the percentages?

```PowerShell
Write-TipAsk -LeftPercentage 55 -MiddlePercentage 60 -RightPercentage 65
Write-TipAsk 55 65 75
```

Don't want to use PowerShell (does not keep colored formatting)? You can copy the raw text from: 

```bash
curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/baileydauterman/dd3fb3a9398aaaeb55d0d00f66cddb05/raw
```

(This is satire and only writes the tip on the screen. Will not do anything other than that. You will not be compensated for using it.)
